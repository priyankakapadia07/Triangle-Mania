Variation of Conway's Game of Life - [Link to video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZjODqikVyk)

This project is a variation of Conway’s Game of Life using the open-source graphical library called Processing. It is a generative art piece that relies on the user to select cells on a grid and
view how they interact with one another based on a specific set of conditions. The desired outcome is an assortment of intricate patterns resulting from the formation of cells on the grid.
The final project uses Processing as it is the software we were most familiar with after learning key concepts from the workshop sessions in class. With Processing, we were able to create a
triangle based grid instead of a square based one to create some variation between Conway’s original work. The mousePressed function allows the participant to click and create two triangles
while considering them as one grid cell. Similar to John Conway’s “Game of Life”, the project includes simple shapes alongside a set of conditions to invoke movement, variety, and a sense of infinity.

In Conway’s generative artwork, the participant is able to click anywhere on the grid to place a square shaped cell. After running the program, the cells seemed to differentiate in their actions
based on specific set of conditions which resulted in a mesmerizing display of patterns and movement in the project. Our project also shares similar concepts but with additional elements
such as audio and colour change. Incorporating conditions based on the positions of the cells on the grid, each assortment of cells presented a different reaction; ultimately generating a
beautiful display of generative patterns. For instance, by increasing the number of live neighbors to 3 and 4 changed the overall output of the game entirely as all the cells died at much higher
rates. Additionally, by incorporating music into the mix, the game proved to be more enticing and adds to the ambience of the piece. When the program is paused, mousePressed changes
the frequency of the music whilst cells are added.
